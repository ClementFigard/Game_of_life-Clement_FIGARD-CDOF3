# Game of Life

## Description

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This project is a console-based Python implementation of the Game of Life. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a set of rules based on the states of its neighboring cells.
